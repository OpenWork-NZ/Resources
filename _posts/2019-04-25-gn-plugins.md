Before you can install a metadata plugin into GeoNetwork, you need to compile it with the rest of GeoNetwork. We'll publish instructions for doing this yourself, but in case you don't want to go through that here's some precompiled/compressed WAR files:

* [iso19115-3.2018.zip](/Resources/iso19115-3.2018.zip)
* [iso19139.anzlic.zip](/Resources/iso19139.anzlic.zip)
* [iso19139.mcp-1.4.zip](/Resources/iso19139.mcp-1.4.zip)
